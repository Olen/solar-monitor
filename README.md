# solar-monitor

This utility monitors defined BLE-devices, and sends parsed data to a remote server using either MQTT or json/HTTP

Currently supported
- SRNE regulators (monitored by the SolarLink APP: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shuorigf
- Lithium Batteries:
  - monitored by the Meritsun APP: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meritsun.smartpower
  - monitored by Renogy DC Home APP: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.renogy.dchome)
  - monitored by TBEnergy APP: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topband.smartpower
- Victron Energy - VE.Direct devices - currently only Phoenix inverters are tested.  Work in progress to add more devices
- Renogy BT-1 (uses the same protocol as the SolarLink/SRNE)

# Requirements
Look at requirements.txt

Be aware that libscrc is NOT pip-installable on all versions of RPI, so you need to build it from source: https://github.com/hex-in/libscrc

The monitor runs fine on a Raspberry Pi zero, making it ideal for monitoring places where there is no grid power, as it uses a minimal amount of power.

# Docker

To run the service as a container, you can use the included `docker-compose.yaml`

* Copy `solar-monitor.ini.dist` to e.g `~/solar-monitor/solar-monitor.ini`
* Edit the ini-file as per the instructions below.
* Ensure that docker-compose.yaml has the right path to the ini-file
* Run:

```
docker-compose up -d
```
in the same dir as you downloaded these files.  This might take some time, depending on your build host.

Check the logs with

```
docker logs solar-monitor
```

`network=host` is needed because access to bluetooth devices requires host network.


# Running as a service

You need the following:

* solar-monitor.py  The actual daemon 
* solardevice.py    Extension of ble gatt and some classes to store the values that are read from the BLE-devices
* duallog.py        CLI and file-logger with multiple destinations
* datalogger.py     Class for pushing data to remote servers
* plugins/*         Implemetation of vendor specific BLE parsing

Also

* solar-monitor.service - A systemd service-description for auto-starting the service
* solar-monitor.ini.dist  Configuration-file. To be modified and renamed to solar-monitor.ini

Copy solar-monitor.ini.dist to solar-monitor.ini, and add the correct mac addresses to your BLE devices (NOT your mobile phone with the app, but the actual battery/bluetooth adapter)

Copy solar-monitor.service to /etc/systemd/system/ and run
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable solar-monitor
systemctl start solar-monitor
```
The systemd unit file might need some adjustments to point to the right scripts

Alternatively just run `solar-monitor.py` in something like termux or screen (might require root privileges to access bluetooth directly)

Updates can be sent to a remote server using either MQTT or JSON over HTTP(s)


## MQTT
By using MQTT you will also get a listener for each topic, that can be used to set certain parameteres
E.g. the app is sending MQTT states as
`prefix/regulator/power_switch_state/state = 0`

And you can turn power on and off by sending
`prefix/regulator/power_switch_state/set = 1`
from another MQTT client connected to the broker.  *So do NOT connect to public brokers!*

The MQTT-implemetation will automatically create sensors and switches in Home Assistant according to this spec: https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/

## JSON
The data will be posted as JSON to a given URL as an object:
```
{"device": "battery_1", "current": -0.5, "ts": "2020-04-19 21:36:55"}
{"device": "battery_1", "state": "discharging", "ts": "2020-04-19 21:36:55"}
{"device": "regulator", "power_switch_state": 0, "ts": "2020-04-19 21:36:56"}
{"device": "battery_1", "current": 0.0, "ts": "2020-04-19 21:36:56"}
{"device": "battery_1", "state": "standby", "ts": "2020-04-19 21:36:57"}
{"device": "battery_1", "capacity": 105.1, "ts": "2020-04-19 21:41:26"}
```

This allows you to remotely monitor the data from your installation:
